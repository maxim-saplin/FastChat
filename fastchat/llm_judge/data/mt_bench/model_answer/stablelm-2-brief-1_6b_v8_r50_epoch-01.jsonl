Let me start with this: Probability is a measurement of how likely something is to happen. It can be used to determine the likelihood of a situation occurring, such as whether a coin will land on heads or tails, or whether a person will get a certain score on a test. In order to understand this concept, you can think of probability as being like a coin flip: The probability of heads is 50%, and the probability of tails is 50%. If you flip a coin 100 times, the probability of getting heads 50 times and tails 50 times is 50% (since there are 2 possible outcomes, heads or tails). If you flip the coin 100 times, the probability of getting heads 10 times and tails 90 times is 50%. You can see how this works by counting the number of heads and tails and dividing by the total number of flips. The 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails) are not equally likely, and the probability of getting one outcome is determined by the number of times that outcome occurs. For example, if you flip a coin 100 times, the probability of getting heads 50 times is 50%, and the probability of getting tails 50 times is 50%. However, if you flip a coin 100 times, the probability of getting heads 10 times and tails 90 times is 50%. This is because if you flip a coin 100 times, the probability of getting heads 10 times and tails 90 times is the same as the probability of getting heads 10 times and tails 90 times, since there are 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). In summary, probability is a measurement of how likely something is to happen. It can be used to determine the likelihood of a situation occurring, such as whether a coin will land on heads or tails, or whether a person will get a certain score on a test.", "Riemannian geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the geometry of curved surfaces that can be represented by Riemannian manifolds. Euclidean geometry, on the other hand, is a branch of mathematics that studies the geometry of flat surfaces that can be represented by Euclidean spaces. The two types of geometry have their own unique properties and applications; Riemannian geometry is often used in areas such as physics, astronomy, and computer graphics, while Euclidean geometry is used in areas such as geometry, trigonometry, and algebra.\n\nThe main difference between Riemannian geometry and euclidean geometry lies in the way that the two types of geometry represent curved surfaces. In Riemannian geometry, the surface is represented by a differentiable manifold with a metric tensor field, which measures the distance between the points on the surface. This metric tensor field is often represented by a Riemannian metric or a Riemannian metric tensor field. In euclidean geometry, the surface is represented by a flat plane or a flat three-dimensional space, and the distance between points on the surface is measured by a distance function that is always positive.\n\nRiemannian geometry and euclidean geometry have their own unique properties and applications, but they are not mutually exclusive. For example, Riemannian geodesics are often used in the study of curvature in Riemannian manifolds, while euclidean geodesics are often used in the study of curvature in euclidean spaces. Similarly, Riemannian metrics can be used in the study of differential geometry, while euclidean metrics can be used in the study of differential geometry.\n\nIn summary, Riemannian geometry and euclidean geometry have their own unique properties and applications, and they are not mutually exclusive.

For each file, it opens it in read mode using the `with` statement and reads the contents of the file using the `strip` method.
